# TiTo and Z-infinity Calendar Integration Concept

## Overview
Integrate the time tracking data from TiTo with the Z-infinity Calendar to provide a comprehensive view of time management and scheduling.

## Key Features

1. Data Import:
   - Z-infinity Calendar to read JSON exports from TiTo
   - Option for real-time sync if both applications are running simultaneously

2. Time Entry Visualization:
   - Display TiTo time entries as events in Z-infinity Calendar
   - Color-code entries based on projects or categories from TiTo

3. Time Analysis:
   - Use Z-infinity's zoom functionality to analyze time usage patterns
   - Aggregate TiTo data at different time scales (day, week, month, year)

4. Interactive Features:
   - Click on calendar events to view detailed TiTo entry information
   - Option to edit TiTo entries directly from the calendar interface

5. Scheduling Assistance:
   - Use historical TiTo data to suggest optimal times for future tasks
   - Identify time slots for specific projects based on past productivity patterns

6. Reporting:
   - Generate visual reports combining calendar events and time tracking data
   - Export integrated data for further analysis in other tools

## Implementation Considerations

1. Data Format Compatibility:
   - Ensure TiTo's JSON export format is easily parsable by Z-infinity
   - Consider creating a standardized format for easy future integrations

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement efficient data loading to handle large TiTo datasets
   - Use lazy loading techniques when displaying data across different zoom levels

3. User Privacy:
   - Allow users to control which TiTo data is imported into the calendar
   - Implement data encryption for sensitive time tracking information

4. Customization Options:
   - Allow users to configure how TiTo data is displayed in the calendar
   - Provide filters to show/hide specific types of time entries

This integration would create a powerful time management tool, combining the detailed tracking of TiTo with the innovative visualization of Z-infinity Calendar.
